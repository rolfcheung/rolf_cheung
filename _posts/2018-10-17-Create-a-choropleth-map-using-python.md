We will present an introduction to how to create a choropleth map using python. 
The method being used here to a great extent depends on Stephan HÃ¼gel's [tutorial](https://sensitivecities.com/so-youd-like-to-make-a-map-using-python-EN.html#.W8dd9hNKgXo). The difference is that we will create this map based on a python package called [Geopandas](http://geopandas.org/) rather than the matplotlib Basemap toolkit which is more complex. with respect to our main purpose, we will present a much more smaller program.


```python
def choro_map_python(intro,package, plotting):
	pass
```
